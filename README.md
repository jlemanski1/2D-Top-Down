# 2D-Top-Down
2D Top down project inspired by games like Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, etc. Created as a fun project to work on during school.

Base systems are currently being implemented, once the backend has enough substance, this readme will be updated with the future plans, direction, and overall theme/vibe of the game
